Things thought when designing:
1.Looks and finish should be decent
2.User should be easily able to identify which input box is for what value.
3.Responsive design on different device screens.
4.Least buffering for better user experience.

Features implemented:
1.Takes url,caption and timestamp input.
2.Search button to search for hosted video and generate video using react-player.
3.Created a video player component that can handle all kind of video
4.implemented a histroy list of all the video we have played.
5.Responsive across different device screens.

Trade off:
1.Timestamp validation is not done,timestamp is taken in text format, which would allow the user to enter any value,I have handled the error using try catch.
2.The history list implemented can be clicked to play that video.

If more time was given:
1.Will implement data validation,so correct data formate is entered.
2.Implement contextAPI to handle playing url, so we can play videos even from List (History List).
3.Implement sort or search bar to search from the history list.
